# Analytics Goals

Final goal: Predict whether the violated driver or pedestrian will be arrested?

4 machine learning algorithms:

- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting 
- DeepLearning
- XGBoost


# Data Pipeline

- Step1: Store data in AWS S3 Bucket
- Step2: Reading from S3, preprocess data using Pyspark on AWS EMR
- Step3: Write processed data parquet ready for model fitting back to S3
- Step4: Machine Learning on AWS EMR
